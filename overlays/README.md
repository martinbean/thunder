# Overlays
The game has two overlays that are swapped in and out of RAM at runtime, one for the main menu, and one for gameplay. These overlays are stored in **WMENU.BIN** and **WGAME.BIN** respectively.

> [!NOTE]
> Do not copy the files from the ROM as is. They are encoding using run-length encoding (RLE) and need decoding before decompiling.
